# Battleship Game in Python

## Description
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game.  
It allows players to place ships on a grid, fire at enemy positions, and record game scores.

## Features
- Ship placement on a 10x10 grid  
- Validation of input coordinates  
- Turn-based shooting and board updates  
- Display of the board after each turn  
- Score calculation and saving

## Installation
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).  
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.  
3. Install the required dependencies with:
   ```sh
   pip install pyinputplus
   ```
4. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. The program will prompt you to place your ships on the grid.  
2. You then take turns firing at the opponent’s grid by entering coordinates.  
3. The game continues until one player sinks all of the opponent’s ships.  
4. Scores are saved and displayed at the end of the game.

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface  
- Implement an online multiplayer mode  
- Develop a more advanced AI opponent
